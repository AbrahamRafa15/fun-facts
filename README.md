# Fun Facts About Animals

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project was inspired by 'Learn React: Introdution', from [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com)

## Installation

First, you need Node.js\
In case you don't have Node.js installed in your computer, you can find the instructions in this site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
> [!Warning]
> In this project we used nvm and npm

Verify that Node.js is correctly installed with `node -v` and `npm -v`

## Create a project with React

> [!Important]
> This section is in case you don't clone the repository and make a new project

Choose a location in your computer or create a new directory, open a terminal window in the directory\
Run the command `npx create-react-app name-of-proyect`
This will create all the files required to run your project

Change to the project directory and run `npm start`
This will open the template for any React project at [http://localhost:3000]http://localhost:3000.

After that, you can access in any code editor to modify your project

## Understanding `App.js`

The `App.js` file is the main component that runs the app. It contains the logic for displaying the fun facts about animals and handling user interactions. Here's a brief overview:
- The state is initialized with an empty message.
- When an animal image is clicked, a random fun fact is displayed about the selected animal.
- The `App.js` file uses React hooks like `useState` to manage the state of the application.

## Available Scripts

When you clone this project, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
